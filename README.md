# Property-driven development (PDD)

PDD is a novel top-down RTL design methodology called Property-Driven Development (PDD). 
The methodology starts from an abstract, transaction-level, hardware description in SystemC and produces a fully and formally verified RTL implementation. 

We present:
- The open-source software tool *SCAM* supporting PDD. The repository contains the source code for SCAM and various examples (e.g.,  a RISC-V processor). 
- In the *LowPower* repository, we provide RTL designs and auxiliary files required to demonstrate dynamic power optimization based on formal properties.
