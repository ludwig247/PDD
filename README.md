# Property-driven development (PDD)

PDD is a novel top-down RTL design methodology called Property-Driven Development (PDD). 
The methodology starts from an abstract, transaction-level, hardware description in SystemC and produces a fully and formally verified RTL implementation. 

We present:
- The open-source software tool *SCAM* supporting PDD.
Using the tool, we develop an abstract system-level CPU model for the RISC-V R32I instruction set and refine it to an RTL implementation.
Two different implementations for the same abstract model are provided.
- What ever you want to write about LowPower
